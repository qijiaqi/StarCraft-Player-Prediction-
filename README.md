We consider the video game StarCraft 2. This real-time strategy game is played competitively by cyber-athletes as an electronic sport (esport), and most of the competitions are played online. A major issue for competition organizers is that they need to verify the identify of a player, for being sure that it is not another player (a friend with better chances, â€¦).

For that matter, we propose to study how it is possible to determine who is playing given a behavioral trace (game events produced by the player) by designing a prediction model using machine learning techniques.

You are provided with a large set of SC2 replay data, from which you need to build features and train a model. Once your model is ready, apply it on the test data and submit your result!
